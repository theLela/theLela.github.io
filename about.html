	        <p class="description">Hi, my name is Jelena Jovanovic, but I prefer my nickname - Lela. :) After I got a degree from Faculty of Economics, University of Belgrade, I've decided to change the direction of my education path and learn something about information systems and technologies. During my postgraduated studies at the Faculty of Organizational Sciences, I've learned some basic concepts about programming and gained a broader picture about what fields can further be explored. However, through numerous courses and tutorials on the Internet I've discovered that web development is the most appealing to me. I will definitely continue with my own projects and self-learning process, but I am also looking for any internship or job opportunity which could help me to start my career, to the mutual satisfaction. :)</p>
